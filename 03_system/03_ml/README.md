Scaling for increased demand (same as in distributed systems)
Scaling general SW system (distributed servers, load balancer, sharding, replication, caching, etc)
Train data / KB partitioning
Scaling ML system
Distributed ML
Data parallelism (for training)
Model parallelism (for training, inference)
Asynchronous SGD
Synchronous SGD
Distributed training
Data parallel DT, RPC based DT
Scaling data collection
MT for 1000 languages
NLLB
Monitoring, failure tolerance, updating (below)
Auto ML (soft: HP tuning, hard: arch search (NAS))

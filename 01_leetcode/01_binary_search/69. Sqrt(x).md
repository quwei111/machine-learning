## solution

- 二分法
```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x == 0:
            return 0
        
        l = 1
        r = x
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            sqrt = x / mid
            if sqrt == mid:
                return mid
            elif sqrt > mid:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid - 1
        return r

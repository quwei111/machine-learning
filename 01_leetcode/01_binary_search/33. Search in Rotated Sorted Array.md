# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
[https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## solution
- 根据rotate的不同，分为两种情况
- 每种情况分别执行二分搜索

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # 左闭右闭
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1

        while l <= r:
            m = l + (r - l) // 2
            if nums[m] == target:
                return m
            elif nums[m] >= nums[l]:  # 各个边界非常容易出错
                if target < nums[m] and target >= nums[l]:
                    r = m - 1
                else:
                    l = m + 1
            else:
                if target > nums[m] and target <= nums[r]:
                    l = m + 1                                  
                else:
                    r = m - 1                     
                    
        return -1
```

[https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

## solution
递归
```python

```

迭代
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is None or head.next is None:
            return head
        
        pre = None
        cur = head
        while cur is not None:
            tmp = cur.next
            cur.next = pre
            pre = cur
            cur = tmp
        return pre

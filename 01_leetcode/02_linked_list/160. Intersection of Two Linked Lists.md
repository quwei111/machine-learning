# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
[https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

## solution
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        l = []
        cur1 = headA
        while cur1 is not None:
            l.append(cur1)
            cur1 = cur1.next
        
        cur2 = headB
        while cur2 is not None:
            if cur2 in l:
                return cur2
            cur2 = cur2.next
        return None

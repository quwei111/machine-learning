# 142. Linked List Cycle II
[https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null. 

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.

## solution
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is None or head.next is None:
            return None
        
        slow = head
        fast = head
        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

            if slow == fast:
                fast = head

                while slow != fast:
                    slow = slow.next
                    fast = fast.next
                return slow
        return None
```

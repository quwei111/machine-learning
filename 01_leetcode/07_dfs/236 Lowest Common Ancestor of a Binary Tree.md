# 236 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
[https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

## solution
- 后续遍历，自底向上的回溯。
- 沿着树递归，注意如何最终返回最近公共祖先

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':

        if root is None or root == p or root == q:
            return root

        l = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        r = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

        if l and r:
            return root
        if l:
            return l
        if r:
            return r

# 235 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
[https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

## solution
- 思路是找到第一个位于p、q之间的节点

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if root.val < p.val and root.val < q.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        elif root.val > p.val and root.val > q.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        else:
            return root
```

# 23. Merge K Sorted Lists
[https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

## solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

import heapq


class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        res = []
        for head in lists:
            while head:
                heapq.heappush(res, head.val)
                head = head.next
        
        dummy = head = ListNode(-1)
        while res:
            head.next = ListNode(heapq.heappop(res))
            head = head.next

        return dummy.next
```

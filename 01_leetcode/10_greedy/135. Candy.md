[https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

## solution

```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        res = [1 for _ in range(len(ratings))]
        for i in range(1, len(ratings)):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
                res[i] = res[i-1] + 1

        for j in range(len(ratings)-1, 0, -1):
            if ratings[j] < ratings[j-1]:
                res[j-1] = max(res[j-1], res[j]+1)

        return sum(res)
```

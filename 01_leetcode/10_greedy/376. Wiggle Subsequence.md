## solution

- 注意这里的判断条件

```python
class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:        
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return len(nums)
        
        pre = 0
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            diff = nums[i] - nums[i-1]

            if pre * diff <= 0 and diff != 0:
                res += 1
                pre = diff
        return res
```

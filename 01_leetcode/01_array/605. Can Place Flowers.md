# 605. Can Place Flowers
[https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)

Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

## solution
- 为减少边界条件判断，前后各增加一块空地。注意循环的边界
- 为剪枝，从n开始倒计时

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        flowerbed = [0] + flowerbed + [0]
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(flowerbed) - 1):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0 and flowerbed[i-1] == 0 and flowerbed[i+1] == 0:
                res += 1
                flowerbed[i] = 1
        return n <= res
```

# 605. Can Place Flowers
[]()

Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

## solution
- 为减少边界条件判断，前后各家一块空地
- 为剪枝，从n开始倒计时

```python

```

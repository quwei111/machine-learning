# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
[https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/)

iven an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

## solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        nums = list(set(nums))
        nums.sort()
        res = 1
        temp = 1
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            if nums[i+1] == nums[i] + 1:
                temp += 1
                res = max(res, temp)
            else:
                temp = 1
        return res
```

# 统计

P-value, correlation matrix, t-test, VIF, R2, adjusted R2，ANOVA，F-test，Null hypothesis testing

## z检验

## t检验

## confidence interval

## 蒙特卡洛



## AB test
- sample size计算
- 不同element increase/decrease对power的影响

## 独立同分布IID
机器学习领域的重要假设

## 常见面试问题
- What is p-value? What is confidence interval? Explain them to a product manager or non-technical person.. (很明显人家不想让你回答: 画个正态分布然后两边各卡5% (￣▽￣)" )
- How do you understand the "Power" of a statistical test?
- If a distribution is right-skewed, what's the relationship between medium, mode, and mean?
- When do you use T-test instead of Z-test? List some differences between these two.
- Dice problem-1: How will you test if a coin is fair or not? How will you design the process(有时会要求编程实现)? what test would you use?
- Dice problem-2: How to simulate a fair coin with one unfair coin?
- 3 door questions.
- Bayes Questions:  Tom takes a cancer test and the test is advertised as being 99% accurate: if you have cancer you will test positive 99% of the time, and if you don't have cancer, you will test negative 99% of the time. If 1% of all people have cancer and Tom tests positive, what is the prob that Tom has the disease? (非常经典的cancer screen的题，做会这一道，其他都没问题了)
- How do you calculate the sample size for an A/B testing?
- If after running an A/B testing you find the fact that the desired metric(i.e, Click Through Rate) is going up while another metric is decreasing(i.e., Clicks). How would you make a decision?
- Now assuming you have an A/B testing result reflecting your test result is kind of negative (i.e, p-value ~= 20%). How will you communicate with the product manager?
If given the above 20% p-value, the product manager still decides to launch this new feature, how would you claim your suggestions and alerts?
